FUNCTION DTOpen(volName: Str255; vRefNum: INTEGER; VAR dtRefNum: INTEGER; VAR newDTDatabase: BOOLEAN): OSErr;
{
    The DTOpen function opens a volume's desktop database. It returns
    the reference number of the desktop database and indicates if the
    desktop database was created as a result of this call (if it was created,
    then it is empty).
    volName         input:  A pointer to the name of a mounted volume
                            or nil.
    vRefNum         input:  Volume specification.
    dtRefNum        output: The reference number of Desktop Manager's
                            desktop database on the specified volume.
    newDTDatabase   output: true if the desktop database was created as a
                            result of this call and thus empty.
                            false if the desktop database was already created,
                            or if it could not be determined if it was already

{
    The DTGetComment function gets a file or directory's Finder comment
    field (if any) from the Desktop Manager or if the Desktop Manager is
    not available, from the Finder's Desktop file.
    IMPORTANT NOTE: Inside Macintosh says that comments are up to
    200 characters. While that may be correct for the HFS file system's
    Desktop Manager, other file systems (such as Apple Photo Access) return
    up to 255 characters. Make sure the comment buffer is a Str255 or you'll
    regret it.
    
    vRefNum input:  Volume specification.
    dirID   input:  Directory ID.
    name    input:  Pointer to object name, or nil when dirID
                    specifies a directory that's the object.
    comment output: A Str255 where the comment is to be returned.
