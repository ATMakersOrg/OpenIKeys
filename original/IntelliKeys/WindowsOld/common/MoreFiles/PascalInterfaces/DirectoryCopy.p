FUNCTION FilteredDirectoryCopy(srcVRefNum: INTEGER; srcDirID: LONGINT; srcName: Str255; dstVRefNum: INTEGER; dstDirID: LONGINT; dstName: Str255; copyName: Str255; copyBufferPtr: UNIV Ptr; copyBufferSize: LONGINT; preflight: BOOLEAN; copyErrHandler: CopyErrProcPtr; copyFilterProc: CopyFilterProcPtr): OSErr;
{
    The FilteredDirectoryCopy function makes a copy of a directory
    structure in a new location. If copyBufferPtr <> NIL, it points to
    a buffer of copyBufferSize that is used to copy files data. The
    larger the supplied buffer, the faster the copy. If
    copyBufferPtr = NIL, then this routine allocates a buffer in the
    application heap. If you pass a copy buffer to this routine, make
    its size a multiple of 512 ($200) bytes for optimum performance.
    
    The optional copyFilterProc parameter lets a routine you define
    decide what files or directories are copied to the destination.
    
    FilteredDirectoryCopy normally creates a new directory *in* the
    specified destination directory and copies the source directory's
    content into the new directory. However, if root parent directory
    (fsRtParID) is passed as the dstDirID parameter and NULL is
    passed as the dstName parameter, DirectoryCopy renames the
    destination volume to the source directory's name (truncating
    if the name is longer than 27 characters) and copies the source
    directory's content into the destination volume's root directory.
    This special case is supported by FilteredDirectoryCopy, but
    not by FSpFilteredDirectoryCopy since with FSpFilteredDirectoryCopy,
    the dstName parameter can not be NULL.
    
    srcVRefNum      input:  Source volume specification.
    srcDirID        input:  Source directory ID.
    srcName         input:  Source directory name, or nil if
                            srcDirID specifies the directory.
    dstVRefNum      input:  Destination volume specification.
    dstDirID        input:  Destination directory ID.
    dstName         input:  Destination directory name, or nil if
                            dstDirID specifies the directory.
    copyName        input:  Points to the new directory name if the directory
                            is to be renamed or nil if the directory isn't to
                            be renamed.
    copyBufferPtr   input:  Points to a buffer of copyBufferSize that
                            is used the i/o buffer for the copy or
                            nil if you want DirectoryCopy to allocate its
                            own buffer in the application heap.
    copyBufferSize  input:  The size of the buffer pointed to
                            by copyBufferPtr.
    preflight       input:  If true, DirectoryCopy makes sure there are
                            enough allocation blocks on the destination
                            volume to hold the directory's files before
                            starting the copy.
    copyErrHandler  input:  A pointer to the routine you want called if an
                            error condition is detected during the copy, or
                            nil if you don't want to handle error conditions.
                            If you don't handle error conditions, the first
                            error will cause the copy to quit and
                            DirectoryCopy will return the error.
                            Error handling is recommended...
    copyFilterProc  input:  A pointer to the filter routine you want called
                            for each item in the source directory, or NULL
                            if you don't want to filter.

    FSpDirectoryCopy, the dstName parameter can not be NULL.
    
    srcVRefNum      input:  Source volume specification.
    srcDirID        input:  Source directory ID.
    srcName         input:  Source directory name, or nil if
                            srcDirID specifies the directory.
    dstVRefNum      input:  Destination volume specification.
    dstDirID        input:  Destination directory ID.
    dstName         input:  Destination directory name, or nil if
                            dstDirID specifies the directory.
    copyName        input:  Points to the new directory name if the directory
                            is to be renamed or nil if the directory isn't to
                            be renamed.
    copyBufferPtr   input:  Points to a buffer of copyBufferSize that
                            is used the i/o buffer for the copy or
                            nil if you want DirectoryCopy to allocate its
                            own buffer in the application heap.
    copyBufferSize  input:  The size of the buffer pointed to
                            by copyBufferPtr.
    preflight       input:  If true, DirectoryCopy makes sure there are
                            enough allocation blocks on the destination
                            volume to hold the directory's files before
                            starting the copy.
    copyErrHandler  input:  A pointer to the routine you want called if an
                            error condition is detected during the copy, or
                            nil if you don't want to handle error conditions.
                            If you don't handle error conditions, the first
                            error will cause the copy to quit and
                            DirectoryCopy will return the error.
                            Error handling is recommended...

FUNCTION FSpDirectoryCopy({CONST}VAR srcSpec: FSSpec; {CONST}VAR dstSpec: FSSpec; copyName: Str255; copyBufferPtr: UNIV Ptr; copyBufferSize: LONGINT; preflight: BOOLEAN; copyErrHandler: CopyErrProcPtr): OSErr;
{
    The FSpDirectoryCopy function makes a copy of a directory structure in a
    new location. If copyBufferPtr <> NIL, it points to a buffer of
    copyBufferSize that is used to copy files data.  The larger the
    supplied buffer, the faster the copy.  If copyBufferPtr = NIL, then this
    routine allocates a buffer in the application heap. If you pass a
    copy buffer to this routine, make its size a multiple of 512
    ($200) bytes for optimum performance.
    
    srcSpec         input:  An FSSpec record specifying the directory to copy.
    dstSpec         input:  An FSSpec record specifying destination directory
                            of the copy.
    copyName        input:  Points to the new directory name if the directory
                            is to be renamed or nil if the directory isn't to
                            be renamed.
    copyBufferPtr   input:  Points to a buffer of copyBufferSize that
                            is used the i/o buffer for the copy or
                            nil if you want DirectoryCopy to allocate its
                            own buffer in the application heap.
    copyBufferSize  input:  The size of the buffer pointed to
                            by copyBufferPtr.
    preflight       input:  If true, FSpDirectoryCopy makes sure there are
                            enough allocation blocks on the destination
                            volume to hold the directory's files before
                            starting the copy.
    copyErrHandler  input:  A pointer to the routine you want called if an
                            error condition is detected during the copy, or
                            nil if you don't want to handle error conditions.
                            If you don't handle error conditions, the first
                            error will cause the copy to quit and
                            DirectoryCopy will return the error.
